9 - What is a nested conditional?
    Once an if condition is met, you can build another one inside of it.
10 - Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
    No

    The code will continue to execute in a loop until the condition is met as True
12 - What is a for loop? How is it different than a while loop?
    Instead of meeting a boolean condition like a "while" loop, the "for" loop will execute the code as many times are there are items in the given list.
