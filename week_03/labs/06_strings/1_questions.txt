1 - What is a string?
    a sequence of characters
2 - What is an index?
    which character in the string you are referring to

3 - What letter will the following code print? Why?

    word = 'hello'
    index_two = word[2]
    print index_two

    the letter "l"

4 - What is the len() functions used for?
    To get the length (number of characters) of an object.

5 - How can you get the last character of a word using the len() function?
    word = "thisismyword"
print(word[len(word) - 1])

6 - What is string slicing and how does it work?
    getting a segment of a string by using the start and end index in between brackets [start : end]
    print(word[3:5])

7 - How to do slice the string "python" to produce the string "thon"?
    word = "python"
    print(word[2:])

8 - How can you use slicing to store the first and last character of a word in separate variables?
word = "python"
first = word[0]
last = word[len(word) - 1]


9 - What are the answers to Exercise 8.4 (p.80) from the textbook?
def find(word, letter, start_ind):
    index = start_ind
    while index < len(word):
        if word[index] == letter:
            return index
        index = index + 1
    return -1

10 - Can you change one or more character of a string? Why or why not?
    No, because strings are immutable.

11 - What is invocation?
    calling a method

12 - How do you invoke the find() method on the string word with the value 'hello' to find the index of the letter e?
word = "hello"
print(word.find("e"))

13 - Complete Exercise 8.5 (p.80) (Caesar cypher) from the textbook.


14 - Follow the directions for Exercise 8.1 (p.79) until you feel comfortable with the string methods and what methods are available.
