1 - Can you have a list with more than one type?
    Yes

2 - How do you create a list?
    two ways:
    variable_name = list()
    variable_name = [some_value]

3 - How do you nest a list?
    insert square brackets [] within an item of a list
    ie. cheeses = ["cheddar", 1, ["python", "java", "sql"]]

4 - Lists are mutable. Explain this.
    You can change the value of an object within the list.

5 - What does it mean to have the [] operators on the left side of an assignment?
    It is used to specify an index or range of indexes.

6 - What happens with a index value is negative? How does this change how an element is accessed?
    The indexes are accessed starting from the last item first at -1, second to last is -2, etc...

7 - How can you use the in operator to determine in a value exists in a list?
cheeses = ["cheddar", 1, ["brie", "mozarella", "goat"]]
check_value = "cheddar"
cheeses_new = check_value in cheeses

8 - How can you use the + and * operators on lists?
    "+" concatenates two lists
    "*" duplicates the values within the list for x times as requested

9 - What is an augmented assignment statement?
    "+=" adds the right value to the left and the left now keeps that new value

10 - WHat are three ways delete an element from a list? How are they different?
    del: removes the value at the specified index
        del list_name[index]
    pop: same as del but prints it.
        list_name.pop[index]
    remove: removes the specified value. Index is not needed.
        list_name.remove(value)


11 - What is the difference between and list and a string?
    Main difference is that a list can have many values with different data types.

12 - What is the difference between the list() function and the split() method?
    list(): breaks a string into a list of letters
    split(): breaks a string into a list of words

13 - How do you use a delimiter with the split() method?
    Put it in the parenthesis. Default is space " "

14 - What is the `is` operator used for?
    To check if two variables are the same object.

15 - If two objects are identical does that also make them equivalent?
    Yes

16 - If two objects are equivalent does that also make them identical?
    No

17 - What is a reference?
    Assigning an object to a variable.

18 - What is it called when an object has more than one reference?
    Alias

19 - Give an example of an operation that modifies a list.
cheeses = ["brie", "mozarella", "goat"]
cheeses[0] = "cheddar"

20 - Give an example of an operation that creates a new list.
cheeses = ["brie", "mozarella", "goat"]

21 - What is one reason it is important to know the difference between the two kinds of operations above?
    You cannot modify before you createthe list.
