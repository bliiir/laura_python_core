1 - What is the difference between a list and a dictionary?
    While a list's index is an integer, a dictionary's index is dynamic and can be almost any type.

2 - What is a key-value pair?
    It is a pair of items where one of the items represents the other.

3 - How do you add an item to the dictionary first_dict using square
    brackets?
    first_dict["my_key"] = "my_value"

4 - How do you add several items to the dictionary first_dict using
    curly braces?
    first_dict = {"my_key" : "my value", "my_2nd_key" : "my second value" }

5 - When you print out a dictionary, is there a order to the items?
    Why or why not?
    No, because the computer doesn't store them that way.

6 - How do you print out a value using a key?
    first_dict["my_2nd_key"]

7 - How does the in operator work with dictionaries?
    It tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionary. It ignores the values.

8 - What is an implementation?
    It is a way of performing a computation.

9 - Write an example for loop to traverse a dictionary loop_dict and
    print out the keys and values.
loop_dict = {"first": "gold", "second": "silver", "third": "bronze"}
for a in loop_dict:
    print(a, loop_dict[a])

10 - How can you find search for a key given a value.
    What is this called?
    It is called a reverse lookup and you have to do a search. You also have to be careful because the value can be assigned to multiple keys, whereas the keys are unique.


11 - Can lists be keys of a dictionary? Why or why not?
    They cannot because they are not hashable. A hash takes a value and turns it into a integer.

12 - Can lists be values of a dictionary? Why or why not?
    Yes

13 - What is a global variable?
    They can be accessed from any function.

14 - How do you reassign a global variable inside of a function?
    For mutable values, you can just reassign as usual (ie. variable_name = value). But immutable needs to be declared first using the keyword "global".

15 - When do you not need to use the "global" keyword to modify the
    value of a global variable?
    If the value is mutable.
